ELECTRIC VEHICLE RANGE PREDICTION 


🧩 Problem Statement

The growing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has made accurate range estimation one of the most crucial factors for buyers and manufacturers.
However, predicting an EV’s real-world range is challenging because it depends on multiple parameters such as battery capacity, powertrain type, efficiency vehicle design, and price.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict an EV’s range (in kilometers) based on its technical specifications and market attributes.

Week 1 Progress — Data Preparation Phase

## 🧠 Objectives for Week 1
✅ Understand the dataset and its structure  
✅ Handle missing values and inconsistent formats  
✅ Convert text/categorical data into numeric format for ML models  
✅ Save clean and encoded datasets for further processing  

📊 Dataset

Source: EVs-one Electric Vehicle dataset (Kaggle)

Files Used:

EV_data1.csv (original data)

EV_data_encoded.csv (cleaned for ML)

Week 2 Focus: Building and Evaluating Machine Learning Models

In Week 1, the dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and encoded for machine learning.
In Week 2, the focus shifts toward training predictive models that can estimate the real-world range (in kilometers) of Electric Vehicles based on their specifications and attributes.

🎯 Objectives

✅ Split the dataset into training and testing sets
✅ Train multiple regression models for EV range prediction
✅ Evaluate model performance using suitable metrics
✅ Identify the best-performing model based on accuracy and error scores
✅ Save the final model for deployment or future predictions
