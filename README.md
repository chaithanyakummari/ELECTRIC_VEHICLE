ELECTRIC VEHICLE RANGE PREDICTION 


🧩 Problem Statement

The growing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has made accurate range estimation one of the most crucial factors for buyers and manufacturers.
However, predicting an EV’s real-world range is challenging because it depends on multiple parameters such as battery capacity, powertrain type, efficiency vehicle design, and price.
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict an EV’s range (in kilometers) based on its technical specifications and market attributes.
